**Kabuto**

A simple EPS viewer and converter to PNG program based on C++ and GTK3.

Users can now load their EPS images (which we most do not like!), change the background color, perform rotations and save them in PNG format. 

How to:

```
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev

```

then:
```
make
```

Run the program using:
```
./Kabuto
```

Enjoy.
